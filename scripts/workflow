## Start working 
# Start up the VM
gcloud compute instances start kdoran1
# Possibly need:
gcloud auth application-default login
# I can't seem to get locally run tensorboard to connect to a cloud storage,
# instead, run it on the VM and ssh to the port:
gcloud compute ssh kdoran1 --ssh-flag="-N -f -L localhost:12345:localhost:6006"
