# The 'range' setting The range is the network address and subnet mask. For v2-8
# machines, 8 ip addresses are needed, so the network must have 3 bits
# (log_2(8)), so the network mask is 32-3=29 Standard VM projects will already
# have a 10.128.0.0/20 network created for us-central1. The TPU network cannot
# overlap this. This is mentioned in the tpu docs:
# https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/internal-ip-blocks 
# The host-max for the existing network is 10.128.15.254 (with 10.128.15.255
# being the broadcast addr). Thus, the next lowest network address available is
# 10.128.16.0.
